      "Exercise is important, but full health tracking is much more complex. Apple Watch Series 8 has a new temperature sensor that works while you sleep. Cycle Tracking can use that data to estimate ovulation dates - combined with heart rate and cycle data, it gives you a detailed view of your menstrual cycle. It will even let you know if there's possible cycle deviations, like irregular periods. And all your data is safely stored and encrypted, right on your phone. The Apple Watch is as beautiful as ever with an Always-On display, and it's tough enough thanks to crack, dust and water resistance. This hardy buddy can even help you out in a road accident with Crash Detection. It can alert emergency services and your emergency contacts – of course, let's hope you never need that feature",
